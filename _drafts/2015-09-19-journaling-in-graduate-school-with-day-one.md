>One thing I was never able to do, no matter how amazed by journals I was, was to actually start a journal myself. The reason being I mistook a journal for a simple diary where I would write down what I did that day. Just the sheer thought of taking time to write about the egg I ate for breakfast made no sense to me. I didnâ€™t want to write trivial things, I just wanted to write the amazing things like Darwin, or Jefferson. I kept thinking that I was not good enough to start a journal.

* Journaling allows you to understand yourself better
* Journaling allows other people to understand you better
* Journaling reminds you of the little details of your life
* Journaling makes you a better writer
* Journaling is the best motivation you will ever have


## My Setup 

My format currently looks like this[^fn-format]:

	# Day X
	## A headline describing the most important/interesting part of the day

	This is where I write stuff about my day. Sometimes I 

	**Sometimes I'll bold a phrase that I want to stick out.**

	I also write about research ideas, current tech news, or random things that come to mind throughout the day.

I've also been using tags as much as I can to better filter entries when I want to look back. I have a long list of exsiting tags that will keep growing, but I've included a few of my more general and noteable ones below to help someone get started:

* daily
* gt
* new person
* social
* research
* quote
* music
* tech
* exploration
* news
* math
* design

When I started this project I tweeted about it and Day One was kind enough to put the tweet on their [Uses website][uses].
