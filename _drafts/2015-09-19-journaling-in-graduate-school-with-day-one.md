How I have begun a daily journal to dcoument every day of my graudate career and why you should consider one as well.

## Why Journal?

>One thing I was never able to do, no matter how amazed by journals I was, was to actually start a journal myself. The reason being I mistook a journal for a simple diary where I would write down what I did that day. Just the sheer thought of taking time to write about the egg I ate for breakfast made no sense to me. I didnâ€™t want to write trivial things, I just wanted to write the amazing things like Darwin, or Jefferson. I kept thinking that I was not good enough to start a journal.

* Journaling allows you to understand yourself better
* Journaling allows other people to understand you better
* Journaling reminds you of the little details of your life
* Journaling makes you a better writer
* Journaling is the best motivation you will ever have

## Why Day One?



## Journaling in Graduate School



## My Setup 

My format currently looks like this[^fn-format]:

	# Day X
	## A byline describing the most important/interesting part of the day

	This is where I write stuff about my day.

	**Sometimes I'll bold a phrase that I want to stick out.**

	I also write about research ideas, current tech news, or random things that come to mind throughout the day.

I've also been using tags as much as I can to better filter entries when I want to look back. I have a long list of exsiting tags that will keep growing, but I've included a few of my more general and noteable ones below to help someone get started:

* daily (to keep a quick filter for all the entries)
* gt
* new person (to keep a record of any new person I meet)
* social
* research
* quote
* music
* tech
* exploration (exploring a new place)
* news
* math
* visualization

When I started this project I tweeted about it and Day One was kind enough to put the tweet on their ["Uses" website][uses].

## Some Thoughts

Hopefully now you can see the benefits of journaling, especially if you are a student. 

Looking back my first entry was short and described teh set up process for my journal. My next couple dozens of entries were short and walked a fine line between a journal and a diary. But as I slwoly got in the habit of writing something down every day the entries started to grow longer. It wasn't long until my average entry was 750+ words, with an all-time high of 1000+ words. 

As a data enthusiast, the Day One iOS app contains a little bonus feature i teh widget on the notifcitaion screen. Once enaabled the widget will show you a words per day chart. It was encouraging to see this bar chart grow taller adn taller as time went on. If you use Day One on iOS, I recomend checking it out.

I never thought I would keep a journal, write about writing in a journal[^fn-meta], or even enjoy personal writing at all, but one semester down and I'm hooked. Even if you aren't a student I find taht writing special moments, frustrating situations, and new ideas down is a great way to brain dump at the end of a day. 

[^fn-format]: Although I may tweak this in the future. Always open to suggestions!

[^fn-meta]: How meta.
