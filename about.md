#### But you can call me Fred. Nice to meet you. 

I’m a Ph.D. student in the [Polo Club of Data Science][poloclub] studying [Computational Science and Engineering][cse] at [Georgia Tech][gt]. If you aren't familiar with CSE, Wikipedia says it's

>a new discipline that deals with the development and application of computational models and simulations to solve complex physical problems arising in engineering analysis and design as well as natural phenomena. CSE has been described as the "third mode of discovery" (next to theory and experimentation).

But I usually just tell people I make computers do things with numbers.

Here's my [CV][cv] and [resume][resume].

I previously received my B.S. degrees in [Applied Mathematics][ugamath] and [Physics][ugaphysics] from the [University of Georgia][uga]. 

I like to write about the [Stuff I Use][stuff-i-use], take [Photos][photos], and make [Monthly Music][monthly-music] playlists.

## The Longer Version
As a member of the [GT MINED][mined] research group, my research applies data science to speed up the process of new material manufacturing. 

At UGA I explored 3D printing in topology by observing the physical geometry of shapes that are particularly hard to visualize. With the assistance of [Dr. David Gay][dg] I wrote about my research and [my 3D models][thingiverse] sparked interest in the mathematical, 3D printing community. My undergraduate thesis was titled [“3D Printing the Trefoil Knot and its Pages”][trefoil] and it included 3D printed models as well as a gallery of photographs.

I participated in Fairfield University's [Mathematics & Computational Science REU][reu] during the summer of 2014 researching Experimental and Numerical Studies of Oceanic Overflow under [Dr. Shanon Reckinger][sr]. My group presented at various universities, the [American Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics Conference][apsdfd]in 2014, and won Outstanding Poster at the [Joint Mathematics Meeting][jmm] in 2015.

Besides my studies, I'm an [INTJ][intj] born on the coast in Melbourne, Florida but currently live in Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia. I’m interested in a multitude of topics spanning the various disciplines of **data science**, **visual analytics**, **applied mathematics**, **digital design**, and **consumer technology**.

Considered by my family and peers to be a resident techie, I enjoy staying current with consumer technology and computer UI/UX design. When I’m not at my desk crunching numbers, I enjoy playing and discovering music, cycling, and riding motorcycles.
