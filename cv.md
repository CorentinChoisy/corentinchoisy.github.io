# Fred Hohman

I’m a Ph.D. student studying [Computational Science and Engineering][cse] at [Georgia Tech][gt] advised by [Polo Chau][polo] and [Alex Endert][alex]. 

As a member of the [Polo Club of Data Science][poloclub], our research bridges **data mining and machine learning** techniques with principles from **human-computer interaction and visualization** to make interactive tools to help people understand and explore big data.

Here's my [CV][cv].
