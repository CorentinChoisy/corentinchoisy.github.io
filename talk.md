title: Interactive Scalable Interfaces for Machine Learning Interpretability
permalink: talk/

## Abstract
Data-driven machine learning paradigms now solve the world's hardest problems by automatically learning from data. Unfortunately, what is learned is often unknown to both the people who train models and the people they impact. To address these challenges, my research focuses on enabling machine learning interpretability at scale and for everyone, by designing and developing interactive interfaces to help people confidently understand data-driven systems. 

Through my experience collaborating closely with researchers, designers, and practitioners in industry, academia, and the government, my research takes a human-centered approach to understanding what people need to build the right tools for understanding machine learning. More specifically, my research operationalizes interpretability in practice by building a design probe that investigates the emerging practice of interpretability. This system has been deployed at Microsoft Research and demoed for executive leadership. From this operationalization, I built a system to scale interpretability to large-scale neural networks and data that summarizes and visualizes what features a deep learning model has learned and how those features interact to make predictions. Due to rapid democratization, since machine learning now impacts everyone, I use interactive articles, a new medium to dynamically communicate complex ideas, to communicate interpretability and teach people about machine learning's capabilities and limitations, while developing new publishing platforms. These interactives have been read by hundreds of thousands of people.

My interdisciplinary research contributes to human-computer interaction, machine learning, and more importantly their intersection, including open-source interactive interfaces, scalable algorithms, and new, accessible communication artifacts.

## Bio
Fred Hohman is a PhD candidate at Georgia Tech’s College of Computing.

His research focuses on enabling machine learning interpretability at scale and for everyone, by designing and developing interactive interfaces to help people confidently understand data-driven systems. Besides building tools, he also creates data visualizations and writes interactive articles to simply communicate complex ideas.

He has collaborated with designers, developers, and scientists at Apple, Microsoft Research, NASA JPL Human Interfaces, and Pacific Northwest National Lab. He won a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship, a Microsoft AI for Earth Award for using AI to improve sustainability, and the President’s Fellowship for top incoming PhD students. He has also won awards at top conferences such as ACM CHI, ACM KDD, IEEE VIS, and ACM SIGMOD/PODS. He received his B.S. in mathematics and physics.
