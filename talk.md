## Bio
Fred Hohman is a PhD candidate at Georgia Tech’s College of Computing.

His research focuses on enabling machine learning interpretability at scale and for everyone, by designing and developing interactive interfaces to help people confidently understand data-driven systems. Besides building tools, he also creates data visualizations and writes interactive articles to simply communicate complex ideas.


He has collaborated with designers, developers, and scientists at Apple, Microsoft Research, NASA JPL Human Interfaces, and Pacific Northwest National Lab. He won a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship, a Microsoft AI for Earth Award for using AI to improve sustainability, and the President’s Fellowship for top incoming PhD students. He has also won awards at top conferences such as ACM CHI, ACM KDD, IEEE VIS, and ACM SIGMOD/PODS. He received his B.S. in mathematics and physics.
