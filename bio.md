Hi, I'm Corentin Choisy, an epidemiology and biostatistics student at Université Rennes 1, France, and future epidemiology intern at Inserm UMR 1246 SPHERE in Nantes, France.

I'm currently going through my second year of M.S. in Epidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology Modeling, after having obtained a 4th-year degree in Public Health - Quantitative Sciences and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics at Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, France. After completing a narrative review on the subject of multiple testing correction in epidemiology with two classmates in 2022, I've decided to focus my 5th-year studies and internship on epidemiology and advanced biostatistical methodology for epidemiology.
