As my first year of graduate school comes to a close, I spent some time reflecting on my experiences over the past year.

## The End of Ph.D. Year I

CSE at Georgia Tech, the smallest school in the College of Computing, has a great environment for its Ph.D. students and offers courses that are exploding with popularity all throughout Georgia Tech. But a Ph.D. is an apprenticeship with a focus on producing new (and hopefully exciting!) research.

During my first year I've been working in the field of material informatics: a new field that uses the power of data science techniques to better solve problems in materials science. A year ago this seemed like good fit considering my background in math, physics, and interest in data. This year I contributed to handful of related projects too, including bypassing expensive simulations by building a [surrogate model for material grain growth][grain-growth], contributing to the open-source material informatics python package [PyMKS][pymks] developed within the research group, and applying informatics approaches to advanced materials in the [Materials Development Program][mdp] funded by DARPA. Throughout these projects I've worked hard and met wonderful and intelligent people, but as time went on my interest began to fade.

## The Switch

So after much thinking and discussion[^fn-discussion] I have decided to leave my materials informatics work and switch to something that better fits my interests while I am still early in my graduate career. 

I'm fortunate enough that CSE here at Georgia Tech conducts research in many fields. So after, yes, *more thinking and discussion*, I am excited to say that I am joining the [Polo Club of Data Science][poloclub] led by Dr. Polo Chau.

Polo Club's primary research area bridges **data mining and machine learning** techniques with principles from **human-computer interaction and visualization** to make interactive tools to help people understand and explore big data[^research-areas].

This unique combination forces researchers to stay current with the latest analysis and machine learning practices as well as refine visual design and communication through interactive visualizations. Polo recently was [awarded a new NSF grant][polo-nsf] that proposes similar work.

>"It is about how to make sense of a large amount of different kinds of data using 'natural' ways to interact and explore their representations."
>With this award, Abello and Chau will take on the challenge of computer-human interactive exploration of information-rich, billion-scale network data sets.

This research echos my older "math + design" idea in the context of computational science, and I think there's much to be explored. So starting next semester I'll be advised by [Dr. Polo Chau][polo] of CSE and co-advised by [Dr. Alex Endert][alex] of the School of Interactive Computing (IC). This way I can keep one foot in CSE for analytics and one foot in IC for visualization.

## I Was Warned About This

During my senior year at my undergraduate institution, I recall a conversation I had with a math faculty member and a graduating Ph.D. student regarding my future as a graduate student. They both said "However hard you think graduate school is, it's harder." That's probably true, but a supportive community and an exciting work helps ease the difficulty.

[^fn-discussion]: Thank you to those individuals who willingly talked with me, as well as the the ones I trapped!
