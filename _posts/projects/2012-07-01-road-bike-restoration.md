I spent some time restoring and converting a 25 year-old Norco into a road bike.

In 1987 my father was fitted for a Norco hybrid bicycle. After many years of use, the bike was hung from a hook and placed in the back of the garage. In 2012, after my first year of college, I came home in search of a better means of transport around campus.

After cleaning old parts and salvaging what I could, I had a chromoly frame that predated me to build upon. I used [Sheldon Brown’s website][sb] for tips on what to buy. I purchased drop down handlebars, derailleurs, wheels, and other modern hardware from [Performance Bicycle][pb] and began painting and building. I lowered the bike’s total gear count to 16, but that has been plenty to get to class quickly—even over the large hills in Athens, GA.
