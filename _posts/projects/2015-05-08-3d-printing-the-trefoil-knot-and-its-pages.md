At the University of Georgia, I spent three semesters exploring 3D printing techniques in topology under [Dr. David Gay][dg] in the [Mathematics Department][ugamath], in particular, visualizing complex shapes and knots using a [MakerBot Replicator 2][makerbot].

My project involved coding, generating, and manipulating variations of the open-book decomposition of the complement of the trefoil knot in Mathematica to create a "3D printed puzzle" made of multiple pieces that hold together via small magnets. 

During the summer of 2014 I was asked to guest post on [Dr. Laura Taalman’s][lt] 3D printing blog MakerHome. She printed one object every day for a year, including my trefoil knot. I wrote a two-part piece for her website which described in detail the mathematical theory governing my research, the visualization techniques used, and models I had printed thus far. You can read the [introduction here][mhi], [part I here][mh1], and [part II here][mh2]. 


I was then invited to repost this piece on [Wolfram Community][wc]. At the end of 2014 the project spread around the internet and was written about by [3DPrint.com][3dprint] amongst other mathematics blogs, such as this Sketches of Topology post titled ["Mathematics with 3D Printing.”][sot]

After completing the project and 3D printing the final puzzle, I wrote my undergraduate thesis titled ["3D Printing the Trefoil Knot and its Pages"][thesis] and gave a talk at the [2015 UGA CURO Symposium][curo2015].

I also took pictures of some of the configurations of the puzzle which can be seen below.

You can download my models from [my Thingiverse profile][thingiverse] to 3D print for yourself.
