# Hello, I'm Frederick.
*But you can call me Fred. Nice to meet you.*

<!-- {% include nav.html %} -->

I’m a Ph.D. student studying [Computational Science and Engineering][cse] at [Georgia Tech][gt] advised by [Polo Chau][polo] and [Alex Endert][alex]. 

My research combines **data mining and machine learning** techniques with principles from **human-computer interaction and visualization** to make interactive tools to help people explore large graph data and interpret machine learning models.

In 2018 I received the [NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship][nstrf].

When I’m not at my desk crunching numbers, I enjoy playing music, throwing frisbee, and riding motorcycles.

<!-- # [About][about] -->
<!-- I'm an [INTJ][intj] born on the coast in Melbourne, Florida but currently live in Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia.  -->
<!-- I’m interested in the combination of math + art, or more specifically, the intersection of **data science** (machine learning, deep learning, and big data analytics) and **visualization** (visual analytics, information visualization, and digital design). -->

<!-- Considered by my family and peers to be a resident techie, I enjoy staying current with consumer technology and computer UI/UX design. -->
<!-- When I’m not at my desk crunching numbers, I enjoy playing and discovering music, throwing frisbee, and riding motorcycles. -->

# [Projects][projects]
