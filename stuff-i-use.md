I like finding and using new tools to do things. [The Setup][the-setup] in particular contains great interviews of people in diverse areas discussing their tools. This is my setup: the stuff I use.

### What's in my Bag
I carry a custom [Timbuk2 messenger bag][timbuk2] for just about everything. If that isn't enough space, I wear a [Jansport Classic backpack][jansport] for backup.

Ever since I was 10 I've been writing with [PaperMate Clearpoint 0.5mm mechanical pencils][pencil] on blank computer paper (lines get in the way of math!). More recently I've been carrying a single [Moleskin sketchbook][moleskin-sketch] for meetings and research notes. The size is perfect for an all-in-one notebook, and the paper in the sketchbook from the [Art Collection][moleskin-art] is 111lb, which is much thicker than the average Moleskin notebook (it irks me when ink or pencil bleeds through paper). 

When I am out and about, I carry [Field Notes][fieldnotes] in my back pocket and clip an old [REI carabiner][carabiner] to my belt to hold my keys.

### Computer
I'm using a [2016 15" MacBook Pro][mbp], which replaced a [2011 MacBook Pro][mbp2011], which replaced a [late 2007 iMac][imac].

When I'm at my desk at GT or home I connect to the [LG Ultrafine 5K Monitor][monitor] (the single USB-C cable is wonderful!) and use a [Logitech G502 mouse][mouse] and [Code keyboard][keyboard] with Cherry MX Greens. 

### Mobile
I've always had an iPhone for its simplicity, app abundance, and camera. I'm currently carrying a 128GB black [iPhone 7+][iphone] and an old [fourth-gen iPad][ipad].

On my homepage sits many of the mobile versions of the desktop services I use on OS X, but notable mentions include [Fantastical][fantastical] for calendar and reminders, [Dark Sky][darksky] for down to the minute weather predictions (necessary for taking bike rides on campus), [Inbox][inbox] by Gmail for email, and  the data-centric alarm clock [Sleep Cycle][sleep-cycle].

I also wear a space gray [Apple Watch Sport][watch] with the red sport band. Necessary? No. Stylish? A little. Convenient? Certainly. 

### Services
If I'm working, driving, or biking, I'm probably listening to music on [Spotify][spotify]. I rely on [Dropbox][dropbox] as my primary digital workspace. For getting things done I use [Trello][trello] to organize coursework, research, and projects while occasionally creating simple lists in [Wunderlist][wunderlist]. I prefer Trello to other GTD services as it can export specific tasks to my calendar while preserving the task’s due date, time, and notes. 

While browsing the internet and Twitter on [Tweetbot][tweetbot], I constantly save things to my [Pocket][pocket] to read whenever I get a few minutes, whereas I typically store long-term articles and ideas in [Evernote][evernote]. I also use [1Password][1password] for saving passwords and [Mint][mint] for tracking money. [Slack][slack] is always open, and [IFTTT][ifttt] can be handy too. 

I write journal entries in [Day One][day-one] that contain research notes, a days summary, and interesting quotes and pieces I read. I've used Day One off and on for a few years but during the summer of 2015 [I started writing daily entries to log every day of my time as a Ph.D. student][dayone-blog] so that upon graduation I can look back and remember the details, both big and little. I believe daily writing also helps one communicate more effectively and easily.

### Software
For AI and analytics research, I mostly use [Python][python], and for data visualzation I program mostly for the web (HTML, CSS, JS, and [D3][d3]). For more mathy things, I'll default to [Mathematica][mathematica] for continuous problems and [MATLAB][matlab] for discrete ones.

I typeset LaTeX in [TeXShop][texshop], take notes in Markdown with [Mou][mou], and write code in [Sublime Text][sublime].

For 3D printing I use Mathematica and [OpenSCAD][openscad] to generate models, [Blender][blender] for renders and model/mesh manipulation, and [Makerware][makerware] for print preparation. If you are interested in creating your own models, [Tinkercad][tinkercad] is an easy-to-use, free modeling application that runs in the browser---no downloading required! 

I tried [Pixelmator][pixelmator] instead of Adobe’s CC to avoid cost, and it’s been a great tool for visual mock-ups and light photo editing. I also prefer [Alfred][alfred] over OS X’s Spotlight to open files, launch applications, and search the internet, because it’s fast---*really* fast. 

### Audio
As I already said, I spend a majority of my day listening to music. So on both sides of my desk sit [KRK Rokit 5 studio monitors][rokit5] with an accompanying [Rokit 10s subwoofer][rokit10]. I run audio from my computer through a [Presonus Firestudio][firestudio]. 

I carry [Shure SE215 isolating headphones/earbuds][shure] with me at all times as they provide excellent sound on the go, block out exterior noise, and most importantly never fall out of my ears. 

### Photography
As an amateur photographer, I'm shooting with a hand-me-down [Nikon D80][d80], but I always have my iPhone on me to snap a quick picture. A subset of my pictures are macro shots of 3D printed models, so a light tent is my most used accessory. 

### Drums
I received a [Sonor Force 2001 drum set][sonor] when I was 10, and I still play it today. I play [Sabian AA][aa] and [AAX cymbals][aax] and [Evans drumheads][evans]. My drumstick of choice is the [Vic Firth 5A][5a]. For quieter jam sessions, I make less noise on a [Roland electric drum set][roland]. 

### Entertainment
I found Microsoft's ideas more innovative than Sony's regarding the future of the living room so an [Xbox One][xbox] serves as my main entertainment system to play Halo, watch Netflix, and cheer on the Georgia Bulldogs on gameday. A [Chromecast][chromecast] sticks out of my TV too. 

When trying to relax, there is no better companion than an [Eno hammock][eno].
