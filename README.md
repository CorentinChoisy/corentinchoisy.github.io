# Hello, I'm Frederick.
**But you can call me Fred. Nice to meet you.**

I’m a Ph.D. student at [Georgia Tech][gt] studying [Computational Science and Engineering][cse] in the [College of Computing][coc], and this is my website built on [Jeyll][jekyll]: the simple static site generator.

From the Jekyll website,

>Jekyll does what you tell it to do — no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.

I used the [Poole][poole] template and then tweaked it to my needs. I recommend starting here, as Poole provides a vanilla install of a standard Jekyll site.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me!
